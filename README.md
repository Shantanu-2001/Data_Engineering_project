# Data_Engineering_project


I have created a data warehouse project whose primary aim is to design and implement a cloud-based system. This system seamlessly merges data warehousing and business intelligence functionalities, offering organizations a unified, efficient, and scalable platform to meet their data management and analytics needs

1.    Data Ingestion: The process begins with data sources, which can be anything from databases, file shares, or other storage systems. This data is ingested into the system using Azure Data Factory, a cloud-based data integration service that allows you to create data-driven workflows for orchestrating and automating data movement and data transformation.
 
2.    Raw Data Store: After ingestion, the data is stored in its raw form in Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2, which combines the capabilities of Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1 with Azure Blob storage. It's highly scalable and secure data storage that's designed for high-speed analytics.
 
3.    Transformation: Azure Databricks is then used for data transformation. It's an Apache Spark-based analytics platform optimized for the Microsoft Azure cloud services platform. It provides a collaborative environment with a suite of tools for data engineering, machine learning, and analytics.
 
4.    Transformed Data Store: Once the data has been transformed into a more useful format, it's stored back in Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2. This transformed data is now ready for analytics and further processing.
 
5.    Analytics: Azure Synapse Analytics, a limitless analytics service that brings together enterprise data warehousing and Big Data analytics, is used to run deep analytics on the transformed data. It allows for the exploration of insights at scale.
 
6.    Dashboard: Finally, the insights derived from the analytics phase are visualized using dashboard tools like Microsoft Power BI, Looker Studio, and Tableau. These tools allow for the creation of interactive, visual reports, and dashboards that can help in decision-making.
